##MinhoTeam Simulation Tools Package

This repository holds the source code for the MinhoTeam's simulator, based on Gazebo, ROS, Qt and is written in C++. The purpose of this simulator is to allow earlier teams to developp code while sitting in a chair, prior to real implementation. 

The package will in future include the following RoboCup leagues:

 * Middle Size League (MSL)
 * RoboCup Junior Soccer
 * RoboCup@Factory
 * Autonomous Driving
 * General Simulation
 
Where the simulation cannot provide full interface to the user, it will have many tutorials, guides and examples to make the usage of the simulator as smooth as possible.
 
The package will includ the following:
 
 * Standard models and worlds for each league
 * Model plugins to provide ROS interfacing with the model
 * Guides to create, configure and run custom models and worlds
  
*Developed by Pedro Os√≥rio Silva & MinhoTeam @2016*
